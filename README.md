# Got Senioritis?

Ever wanted to create a powerpoint without doing any work? Here's the perfect solution for you! This tool will allow you to copy and paste the link to a news article and will create a power point using paragraphs in the article for each new slide! Also, it uses sentiment analysis to apply a theme to the slide deck, depending on the mood of the article. 

### How to Run Locally:

To run this locally, do the following in the command line:

`export FLASK_APP=__init__.py`

`flask run`

### Instructions:

1. Open the link http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a browser.
2. Copy and paste a news article link.
3. Click submit. 
4. Click the resulting link, and see your new slides in Google Drive!
