Use this tool to help create Google Slide power points super fast!

Simply copy the link to a news article of your choice, and paste it in the text box. Hit Submit, and Google should prompt for access to your account. Once confirmed, the API will create a slide deck using the article by parsing through it and creating new slides for each paragraph in the article. 

Check the link provided to see your new power point slide!
