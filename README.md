# Got Senioritis?

Ever wanted to create a powerpoint without doing any work? Here's the perfect solution for you! 

This tool will allow you to copy and paste the link to a news article and it will create a power point using paragraphs in the article for each new slide! It also uses sentiment analysis to apply a theme to the slide deck, depending on the mood of the article. For example, happier articles are yellow, and sadder articles will have a darker theme applied to it.

### How to Run Locally:

To run this locally, clone this repo and do the following in the command line:

`export FLASK_APP=__init__.py`

`flask run`

### Instructions:

1. Open the link http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a browser.
2. Copy and paste a news article link.
3. Click submit.*
4. Click the resulting link, and see your new slides in Google Drive!

*Note: you must allow Google Drive access in order for it to be able to create the slide deck.


### Inspiration:
This project was created at Hack(H)er413 at UMass Amherst using the Google Cloud Platform APIs.
